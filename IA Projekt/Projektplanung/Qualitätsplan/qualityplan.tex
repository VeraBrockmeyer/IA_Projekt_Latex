	\textbf{Quality goal} &	\textbf{Criteria} & \textbf{Method} & \textbf{Controlling} \\ \hline \hline
%%overall - VR
low latency & 20 ms maximum & simple rooms and the calculation should not be too expensive & testing, fps rate shown in unity \\ \hline
no dropouts & no black frames or errors in the unity project & no expensive calculations, not do many calculations parallel & testing  \\ \hline
immersive & scene should be as real as possible & realistic objects, moving like in reality & testing and questioning users\\ \hline  
%% Scene
learning & ability to learn and test all interactions & learning room, simple, without tasks, always start in this room & user testing \\ \hline
realistic & scene should be as real as possible & realistic objects, moving like in reality, textures & user questioning \\ \hline  
different sizes of objects & small as well as big objects within the scenes & create a room where it is natural that there are different sizes of objects (for example supermarket) & testing and looking for all sizes \\ \hline  
different distances of objects & objects are placed close and far away & close as well as far placed objects within the scenes create a room where it is natural that objects have different sizes (for example supermarket) & testing and looking for all sizes \\ \hline
%% selection near/far
accuracy of selection & user grabs the right object, the space that selects an object is not that big? & user is using best fitting interaction for object, interactions are as good as possible implemented as possible & usability study, tasks, mechanism to recognize if the correct object is picked \\ \hline  
correct movement of an object & if the object is grabbed, the movement of the object is according to the hand & parenting the object to the movement of the controller when it is grabbed & testing, measurement of the positions\\ \hline 
duration to finish a specific task & time, tasks & measure of time between starting and finishing the task & time \\ \hline  
successful fulfilment of a specific task & tasks, correct objects & a mechanism to recognize if the correct object is picked and placed in finishing area & implemented correction, study, testing, measuring error rate \\ \hline 
%%  tasks
understandability of tasks & object, term, assignment of tasks & clear, easy to understand, use common objects & user testing \\ \hline
